How many products will Trendyol sell each day? Forecasting the sales quantity of a product for an online retail is a challenging task. 
Forecasting heavily relies on the historical data and modeling skills. 
In this project, it is expected to develop forecasting methods to predict the next day's sales quantity of the products in Table 1. 
Many decisions such as pricing, inventory placement and etc. require reliable forecasts and inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. 
The data covers daily sales of eight products of Trendyol and includes product, category level, brand and site level details. 
These are provided as explanatory variables. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy. 
Accurate forecasts help businesses in reducing waste and understanding the uncertainty and its risk implications.
