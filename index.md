Many decisions such as pricing, inventory placement and etc. require reliable forecasts and inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. 

The data covers daily sales of eight products of Trendyol and includes product, category level, brand and site level details. 

These are provided as explanatory variables. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy. 

Accurate forecasts help businesses in reducing waste and understanding the uncertainty and its risk implications.
